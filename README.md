# rock-paper-scissors

## Simple game everybody knows:

It's simple little project for my Portfolio. Something to start with. I'm using only vanilla HTML CSS and JavaScript, no libraries, no frameworks. 

## How it works:

You, as a Player chose between three options (rock, paper scissors), by clicking on a button. Computer decides for himself and you get a result.
Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock and Scissors beats Paper. If two players (You and Computer) choses the same, it's a draw. Simple as that. First one to win 5 times wins the Game! Good luck. You're gonna need it.
